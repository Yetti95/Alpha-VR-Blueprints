How to use:
  *
  Currently not able to use with different point clouds unless in unity.
  *
  To draw pull the trigger on the right controller. Right controller is indicated by a model of a controller with a laser     pointer on it.
  *
  To change colors point the controller at the color picker on the left controller and pull the right controller's trigger. Drag to change either the color, the bar along the top, or the saturation, the left color square.
  *
  To change the size of the line you want to draw, the tool that draws the line is called a brush, pull the trigger of the right controller to start a line the drag your thumb over the large circular touch pad. If you drag from left to right the brush will get bigger. Dragging from right to left will make the brush smaller.
  *
  Currently no undo function, but once it is working you can press down on the left half of the large circular touchpad to delete an object. This process is perminate so UNDO WITH CARE.
